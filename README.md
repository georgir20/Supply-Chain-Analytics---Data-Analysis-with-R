# Supply-Chain-Analytics---Data-Analysis-with-R
This repository shows some of the  work I was doing as part of the TU Berlin master course "supply chain analytics". It includes a variety of data analysis with R.

In this course we delevired mutiple shorter homework assignments. All those homework assignments were created together with my fellow student Carlo Schmid.

At the end of the course we also delivered a big case study for the research project SELECT of the logistics department at TU Berlin.
This final case study was created in a group of four people and all work was done in collaboration with my fellow students: Klara Hinze, Nicola Leschke and Carlo Schmid.
The goal of the case study was the proof of concept for an intelligent IT system which automates and dynamically analyzes the transport processes of
inland vessels and thus predicts their arrival times at inland and seaports. Based on the system, situation-specific recommendations for action for the water-side
transport and port handling should be generated and a digital exchange of this information between the actors should be enabled.
For this case study a variety of shipping data were analyzed as well as a ML model was implemented. All final code files as well as the presentation can be found in the folder: Final SCA Case Study.
